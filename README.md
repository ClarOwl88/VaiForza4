This is a school project consisting of an Android app developed with Android Studio.
Contents are:
              -A zip file containing all the necessary files and resources used to create the app
              -The final .apk file for installation
This is a first project, hence it is rough and will probably be continued, since I intend to modify and add functions as I learn along the way.
On screen text is only italian, but I trust it won't be an issue considering the meaning is kind of intuitive anyway...
